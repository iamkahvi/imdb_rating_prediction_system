## Preprocessing
To run construct the dataset, download the CSVs [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset?select=IMDb+names.csv) and preprocess them using the `Data_Munging` notebook. CSVs should be outputted to `content/`.

## Machine Learning Models
This repo contains a Jupyter notebook for each machine learning model (`complexNN`,
`simpleNeuralNetwork`, `ID3`, `DecisionTreesRandomForests-sklearn`) as well as a `Data_Munging` notebook for pre-processing and cleaning the data.
